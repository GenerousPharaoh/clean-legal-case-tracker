## Build Process Update

The build process has been simplified by:

1. Removing the custom Rollup patchers completely
2. Pinning Node.js to version 20.x 
3. Upgrading to the latest Vite (6.x) and Rollup (4.x)
4. Simplifying package.json scripts

This change ensures:
- Better compatibility with Vercel deployments
- Simpler, more maintainable build process
- Improved build reliability
