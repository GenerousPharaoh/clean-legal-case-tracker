# Emergency Rescue Plan for Legal Case Tracker

I've implemented the rescue plan to fix your application. This approach focuses on removing all the complex fixes that were likely causing more problems and ensuring a clean, single React environment.

## What I've Done

1. **Updated package.json**:
   - Set React and React DOM to version ^18.3.0
   - Simplified dependencies

2. **Updated vite.config.js**:
   - Set jsxRuntime to 'classic'
   - Added proper deduplication for React
   - Removed complex configuration

3. **Created environment files**:
   - .env.development with NODE_ENV=development
   - .env.production with NODE_ENV=production

4. **Cleaned up the index.html**:
   - Removed all the polyfill scripts
   - Returned to a clean, simple HTML file

5. **Created a cleanup.sh script**:
   - Removes all ad-hoc fixes and polyfills
   - Cleans dependencies
   - Rebuilds the project in production mode

## How to Use This Fix

1. Make the cleanup script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x cleanup.sh
   ```

2. Run the cleanup script:
   ```bash
   ./cleanup.sh
   ```

3. This will:
   - Remove all the ad-hoc fixes
   - Clean up dependencies
   - Install fresh dependencies
   - Build the project in production mode
   - Verify the build

4. Preview the application:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

5. If it works properly, deploy to Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Technical Explanation

The main issue was likely a mismatch between development and production JSX modes, combined with duplicate React instances. By ensuring a single React version and properly configuring the build environment, this solution addresses the root cause instead of adding complex patches.

This clean approach has the best chance of getting your application working properly for your pitch.
