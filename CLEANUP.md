# Legal Case Tracker V2 - Code Cleanup Summary

## Fixed Issues

1. **ThemeProvider Duplication**
   - Removed duplicate ThemeProvider in `App.tsx`
   - Fixed theme import references throughout the app
   - Now using a single ThemeProvider from `context/ThemeContext.tsx`

2. **Authentication Provider Duplication**
   - Retired the `AuthProvider` from `context/AuthContext.tsx`
   - Created a compatibility layer to ensure old imports still work
   - Standardized on `useAuthStore` from Zustand

3. **Supabase Client Duplication**
   - Found duplicate Supabase clients in the root and lib folders
   - Standardized on the root `supabaseClient.ts`
   - Created adapter in `lib/supabase.ts` for backward compatibility

4. **Error Handling Duplication**
   - Integrated `errorHandler.ts` with `authErrorHandler.ts`
   - Made them work together so both systems receive error notifications
   - Standardized error reporting patterns

5. **Redux Integration Issues**
   - Created a proper `reduxStore.ts` for Redux and Redux DevTools usage
   - Added Provider wrapper in main.tsx
   - Simplified the Redux integration to work alongside Zustand

6. **Project/Case Type Inconsistency**
   - Created a compatibility layer in `types/compatibility.ts`
   - Provided conversion functions between Project and Case types
   - Added documentation about the terminological confusion

7. **Context Directory Structure**
   - Added a central export file in `contexts/index.ts`
   - Now exporting all contexts from a single place
   - Added warnings about the dual directory structure

## Remaining Issues

1. **TinyMCE Initialization**
   - TinyMCE initialization is failing, as seen in console logs
   - This might require additional configuration or setup

2. **Multiple Theme Management Approaches**
   - Still has both `ThemeContext` and Material UI theme systems
   - These should be more tightly integrated

3. **Inconsistent Type Naming**
   - Need to standardize on either "Case" or "Project" terminology
   - Current compatibility layer is just a workaround

4. **Dual Context Directory Structure**
   - Both `context/` and `contexts/` directories exist
   - Should consolidate into a single directory

## Tooling Added

1. **Code Cleanup Script**
   - Added `npm run cleanup` command
   - The script can identify common issues in the codebase
   - Shows warnings for deprecated patterns and inconsistencies

## Next Steps Recommendations

1. **Run TypeScript Type Checking**
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

2. **Install Cleanup Script Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev glob fs-extra chalk
   ```

3. **Fix TinyMCE Initialization**
   - Review console errors related to TinyMCE
   - Update configuration as needed

4. **Consolidate Directory Structure**
   - Move all context files to `contexts/` directory
   - Update imports to use the new paths

5. **Standardize Terminology**
   - Decide whether to use "Case" or "Project" terminology
   - Update all references for consistency

## Team Recommendations

1. **Code Standards Documentation**
   - Document your decisions on folder structure
   - Create naming conventions for consistency

2. **Regular Cleanup Sessions**
   - Run the cleanup script regularly
   - Address issues as they arise rather than letting them accumulate

3. **Dependency Auditing**
   - Consider removing unused dependencies
   - Check for security vulnerabilities
