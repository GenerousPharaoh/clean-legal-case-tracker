# Instructions to Complete the Rebuild

I've fixed the issue that was causing the build to fail. The problem was a duplicate React import in main.tsx that conflicted with the automatic import from the Vite configuration.

## Next Steps

1. Run the rebuild script again:
   ```bash
   ./rebuild.sh
   ```

2. After the build completes successfully, test the application locally:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

3. If everything works properly (no more grey screen), deploy to Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## What Was Fixed

- Removed the duplicate `import React from 'react'` from main.tsx
- This resolves the conflict with the Vite config's `jsxInject` setting that was automatically importing React

The build should now complete successfully, and your application should work properly with all the fixes for the MUI Timeout and Map.clear issues applied.
