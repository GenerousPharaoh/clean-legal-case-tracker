# Simple Fix for Legal Case Tracker

I've created a minimalist approach to fixing your app with the least amount of changes possible.

## What Changed

1. Created a focused `core-fix.js` script that:
   - Adds the Map.clear method if it's missing
   - Adds a targeted error handler for the specific error
   - Doesn't try to change or modify React behavior

2. Updated index.html to load this script first

3. Created a simple script to apply these changes

## How to Apply This Fix

1. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x simple-fix.sh
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
./simple-fix.sh
```

This will apply the minimal changes needed and rebuild your app.

## Test and Deploy

1. Test locally:
```bash
npm run preview
```

2. If it works, deploy to Vercel:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Why This Should Work

Instead of trying to fix every possible issue, this approach focuses only on the core problem: the missing Map.clear method that's causing the grey screen. The minimal script adds this method where needed without trying to change anything else about your application.

If this doesn't work, we can look at more focused alternatives, but I believe this minimal approach has the best chance of success without disrupting your codebase.
