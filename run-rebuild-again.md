# Updated Fix for React Import Conflicts

I've updated the Vite configuration to resolve the React import conflicts. The issue was occurring because:

1. The Vite config was set to automatically inject React imports into all files (`jsxInject` option)
2. But many of your application files already had explicit React imports
3. This caused "Identifier 'React' has already been declared" errors during build

## What I Fixed

I removed the `jsxInject` setting from the Vite configuration file instead of modifying all your source files. This is a more efficient approach since your codebase already has proper React imports.

## Next Steps

Please run the rebuild script again:

```bash
./rebuild.sh
```

After the build completes successfully, test the application locally:
```bash
npm run preview
```

If everything works properly (no more grey screen), deploy to Vercel:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

The build should now complete without React import conflicts, and all the fixes for the MUI Timeout and Map.clear issues should be applied correctly.
